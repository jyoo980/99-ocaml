# P-99: OCaml

Sample solutions to the [Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) adapted for OCaml. 

## Requirements

1. Some version of the OCaml compiler/runtime. Easy enough to get if you have homebrew: `brew install ocaml`
2. Your favourite text editor

## Loading/Running

1. Open a terminal window, run `ocaml` to start up the REPL.
2. Run `#use "<name_of_file>";;` to load the functions into the REPL.
3. Call functions as you would in any REPL.
